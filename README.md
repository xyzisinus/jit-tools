=========

Just-in-time tools for my own convenience.  Happy to share.

You are welcome to copy, give to your friends, and tell everybody to
do so.  Just be honest and do not take credit for it.  That is all.

Instructions for each tool are in the program itself.

List of programs:

readcd.py: Good for load many audio cds (in an audio book, for example)
into .mp3 files.  Automatically name and number the cd and prompt for
the next one.

clean_a_field_in_mysql.py: Serves as an example how to play MySQL db.
